# clinical-trial-data-integrity-dashboard
An end‑to‑end pipeline using SQL, Python, and BI tools to monitor and visualize data quality issues in mock clinical trial datasets.
## Overview

This project simulates an AI‑assisted clinical data management workflow for clinical trials.  
It extracts mock/public clinical data, performs automated data quality checks (missing values, protocol deviations, visit‑wise issues), and presents results in an interactive dashboard for data review teams.
