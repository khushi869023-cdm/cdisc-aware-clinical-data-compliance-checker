# clinical-trial-data-integrity-dashboard
An end‑to‑end pipeline using SQL, Python, and BI tools to monitor and visualize data quality issues in mock clinical trial datasets.
## Overview

This project simulates an AI‑assisted clinical data management workflow for clinical trials.  
It extracts mock/public clinical data, performs automated data quality checks (missing values, protocol deviations, visit‑wise issues), and presents results in an interactive dashboard for data review teams.
## Objectives

- Automate basic data quality checks for clinical trial datasets.
- Visualize key metrics such as missing data %, visit‑wise queries, and site‑level deviations.
- Demonstrate how SQL, Python, and BI tools can support Clinical Data Management (CDM) workflows.
- ## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib / plotly
- **Tools**: Power BI or Tableau, Excel
- **Data**: Mock or public clinical trial datasets (e.g., from ClinicalTrials.gov)
